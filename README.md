# Depth-Adapted-CNN

Demo of Depth-Adapted CNN for RGB-D Cameras (ACCV20)

aCNN.py contains the basic functions for computing depth adapted sampling position.

model.py shows a VGG-16 adapted to depth.

We also propose an extention of our conferece paper which is available here https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.03939

The source code will be released soon.
